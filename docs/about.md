## Technology Stack

-   **OMGUI Server**  
    Lives in this repository and is written in Python.

-   **OMGUI Frontend**  
    Lives in the [omgui-frontend] repo. It is written in [Vue.js], using the composition API with [TypeScript] and [SCSS].  
    The molecule viewer relies on [RDKit] for 2D visualization and [Miew] for rendering interactive 3D molecules.  
    It's based on the [Carbon Design System].

-   **molviz**  
    Uses [RDKit] for 2D rendering and [CineMol] for static 3D molecules.  
    Relies on [Jinja] for basic template rendering.

-   **chartviz**  
    Uses [Plotly] as charting engine, which itself relies on [D3].  
    Relies on [Jinja] for basic template rendering.

-   **OMGUI header**  
    Lives in the [omgui-gh-banner] repo. The [rotating icosahedron header](assets/omgui-header.webp) was created with [Three.js] and then exported to an animated webp image with [FFmpeg].
