### The Stack

-   The OMGUI server lives in this repository and is written in Python.
-   The OMGUI frontend lives in the [omgui-frontend](https://github.com/acceleratedscience/omgui-frontend) repo.  
    It is written in Vue.js, using the composition API with TypeScript enabled.
-   The [chartviz] and [molviz] modules rely on basic template rendering with [Jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com).
-   Molecule rendering uses [RDKit](https://github.com/rdkit/rdkit#readme) for 2D rendering and [cinemol](https://github.com/moltools/CineMol#readme) for 3D molecules.
